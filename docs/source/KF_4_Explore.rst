Dashboard Overview
======================================

Click on the Kids First logo (top left) to get back to the Portal Homepage.
You'll notice that in addition to the navigation bar at the top of the page,
we also have a Dashboard. Let's take a closer look at what the Dashboard can tell us.

Since this is our first time on the portal, let's start with the bottom row. The categories on this row are generalized to the KFDP as a whole. You'll notices each topic has an associated graphic. Mouse over each of the graphics below to get an idea of what is studied using KFDP:
* Studies/Participants
* Member Research Interests
* Most Frequent Diagnoses

Now let's look at the top row. Here we see information specific to your own portal experience.
* Saved Queries
* Authorized Studies
* Cavatica Projects


NOTE:
#### "About the Portal"
* Why is this such a tiny button in the middle of nowhere? There's some good stuff in here, but users are unlikely to click on it.
