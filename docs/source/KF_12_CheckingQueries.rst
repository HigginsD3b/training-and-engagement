Checking Queries
=============================

Note that our query has an unexpected result:


.. figure:: ./images/KidsFirstPortal_32.png
   :align: center

   **Query 3**


We had 222 participants in query one, and 124 participants in query two, but
only 345 in our combined query. One of the participants must be in both queries!

To see which participant it is, edit query 3 to be an `AND` statement:

   :align: center

   **Query 3 'AND'**


To learn more about this participant, let's look at a more detailed view of their
public metadata by clicking on the `Table View` link:

   **Change to Table View**

In this new view, we can see that there is a `+4` icon in her `Age at Diagnoses`
