   **Multiple Filters**

Note that all of your filters are automatically connected by "AND"s, but that
might not always be what you want. If I wanted to see the participants that meet
at least one of my filters, but not all of them, I can click on an "AND" and change
it to "OR", which dramatically changes my results:

.. |pic2| image:: ./images/KidsFirstPortal_22.png
   :width: 45%

Note that when you change one AND/OR selection, it changes *all* of the AND/OR
boxes in that query line.
