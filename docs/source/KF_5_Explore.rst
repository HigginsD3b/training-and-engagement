Exploring Data in the Portal
=============================

Now that all of our accounts are interconnected, let's actually explore the data.

Remember that our goal is twofold:

* Find data that is of interest to us, and
* Get that data onto Cavatica

Step 1 Get logged in to the Kids First DRC Portal

If you aren't still logged in to the Kids First Portal, navigate to
`https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/ <https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/>`_ and use the
credentials you set up previously in this lesson to log in. When you first log in,
you will see this screen:

   **Go To Explore Data**



Step 3 Explore the Explore Data tab

You should now be on a page that looks like this:

   **Explore Data**


It is important to get a sense of what data exists before we start filtering
down and designing an experiment. This page gives us a set of six interactive plots
that display the overall data. You can impose filters on the data in two different
ways:

* By using the filter buttons
* By clicking on portions of any plot

..  Exercise:
    Choose some different options from the **Quick Filters** category and watch
    how your plots change.


    * The most expedient way to do this is to click the **Quick Filters** button. Let's try that now.
    * Choose some different options from the **Quick Filters** category and watch how your **Cohort Results** change.
    * To further refine your **Cohort Results** select more categories along the navigation bar.
    * Clicking on the graphics also adds filters to the data
    * Need to cover how to remove the filter
