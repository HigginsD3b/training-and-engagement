# add page title here

For tutorials that have a landing page, the title will refer to the primary content of each page. For tutorials that do not have a separate landing page, titles should be short and include the goal of the tutorial, e.g., How to launch an AWS instance, How to create a website with Mkdocs.

## Introduction

The introduction should briefly address:

- what is the tutorial about (general topic, e.g., cloud computing with AWS, workflows with Snakemake)?
- what will the user do in this specific tutorial (e.g., create an account on Kids First, create a Manhattan plot)?

## Set up

Provide instructions on computer set up, software installations, and/or file downloads (may include linking to existing tutorials).

## Step 1: do this

Tutorial steps should be written as Step n: Action, e.g., Step 1: Downloading reference file.

Include links to accompanying files for download, like scripts or input files for data downloads

For command-line software installations, provide a test command to check that the installation was successful. 
This could be checking for the software version or help page. Use backticks and javascript tabs to format code blocks.

## Step 2: do that


## Step 3: change this


## Conclusion

Briefly sum up the tutorial key points as a bullet point list (it could be a restatement of the learning objectives if any were stated in the Introduction). 
Use the admonition format:

!!! note "Key Points"
    
    - point1
    - point2
