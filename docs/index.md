# Welcome to the CFDE Training Resource Center!

Our mission as the **Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)** Coordinating Center is to make **Common Fund (CF)** data accessible to researchers like you. Choose from our growing list of tutorials and resources to learn how to access data and perform bioinformatic analyses. 

To get started, visit the [Bioinformatics Skills](./Bioinformatics-Skills/index.md) section to learn how to set up a computing environment and conduct common bioinformatic analyses. 

Learn how to build cohorts at the [Kids First Portal](./Bioinformatics-Skills/Kids-First/index.md) and across multiple CF datasets using the [CFDE Portal](./Bioinformatics-Skills/CFDE-Portal/index.md).
