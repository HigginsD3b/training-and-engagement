---

**An introduction to custom workflows in Terra**

- what is Terra

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    The objectives of this tutorial are to:

    - learn how to set up a docker container

    - learn how to write basic Workflow Description Language script

    - learn how to upload a workflow to use on Terra


=== "Prerequisites"

    - Dockerhub account
    - GCP billing account (+ valid credit card), with Terra added as a billing account user
    - local terminal environment to test code - Mac and Linux terminal. alternatively, all of this could be tested on a GCP instance (just incurs cost to run VMs, but if you are starting small it will hopefully not cost too much)
