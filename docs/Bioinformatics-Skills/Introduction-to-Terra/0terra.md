# Why should I use Terra?



- Interactive web-based GUI & data viz
- Scale up sample processing
- Cost optimization of cloud resources
- Provenance tracking and versioning of workflows, data
- Apply for access to use controlled-access datasets, which in some cases, are only available via cloud platforms like Terra (e.g., Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project [data](https://anvilproject.org/data?query=consortium%3DGTEx%2B%2528v8%2529)
- Secure place to share datasets (designed to meet the security standards required for using and storing human data), workflows, and analysis workspaces with collaborators
- Long-term persistence of data/workflow availability to share with the community (e.g., custom workflows can be uploaded and shared on the platform)

## How does Terra work?
- compute from a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance. For an introduction to the GCP, see our [tutorial](../Introduction-to-GCP/index.md) on setting up GCP instance.
- a workflow of steps to do (written in the Workflow Description Language (WDL)) that may also run certain steps in specified compute environments (docker containers)
- data (upload data to Terra workspace)


## Finding help on Terra

The [support center](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkXAqpR5Hk1ZmNd2-1K2l5Q/videos) of short tutorial videos provide helpful documentation for all users looking to get started with Terraâ€™s basic functions. Importantly, both are actively updated, so users can be sure they are getting the most up to date information. Users can post questions to the [community help forum](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/topics) or directly to Terra by [submitting a request](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/requests/new). There is a [service notification page](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360003692231-Service-Notifications) for scheduled maintenance or service interruptions/errors related to the Terra platform.
