An Introduction to Terra
=========================

Terra is a cloud-based platform developed by the Broad Institute for bioinformatic analysis that aims to allow researchers with non-expert computing skills to conduct large-scale bioinformatic analysis on the Google Cloud Platform.

By giving users both graphical and command line interface options, Terra lowers the barrier to entry for introducing users to cloud computing. The Terra workspaces organize documentation, data/metadata, workflows, analysis notebooks, and outputs in one place; all of which are important components for reproducible research and collaboration.

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    The objectives of this tutorial are to:

    - set up Terra account

    - learn about the Terra platform interface

    - learn how to use existing workflows on Terra

    <!-- - learn how to upload a workflow to use on Terra -->

=== "Est. Cost"

    Testing and running workflows will incur some cost, but Google Cloud Platform gives new users a $300 free trial for 3 months.

    *reassess after deciding on demo analysis*

=== "Prerequisites"

    For using Terra and its *existing* workflows:

    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing account (+ valid credit card). Please see our lesson for [setting up GCP accounts](../Introduction-to-GCP/index.md)

    <!-- For building *custom* workflows on Terra, you'll also need:

    - local terminal environment to test code - Mac and Linux terminal. Alternatively, all of this could be tested on a GCP instance (just incurs cost to run VMs, but if you are starting small it will not cost too much)
    - Dockerhub account
    - familiarity with shell command-line, docker, and Workflow Description Language computer programming -->
