Download Data
==============

In this section, you will learn to access the AWS instance that you just set up and put the dog coat color data files in it.

The coat color data live in a website called [Cyverse](https://www.cyverse.org/). The easiest way to work with these data files is to download them directly into AWS. But **sometimes AWS cannot talk to Cyverse**; when this happens, the fastest way to work with this dataset in AWS is to first download it onto your LOCAL computer and then upload it to AWS.

We are showing you both ways of doing it:

- [Direct Download](Direct_Download.md): Please follow these instructions first. If you succeed, you may skip the next page and proceed to [Install PLINK](../plink_install.md)

- [Upload from Local Machine](Upload_from_Local_Machine.md): If the direct download does not work for you, please follow instructions on this page to download data onto your local machine and then upload it onto AWS
