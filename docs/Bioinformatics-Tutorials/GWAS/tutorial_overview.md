Tutorial Overview
=================


For this tutorial, we will **not** work with human data. We will use coat color in dogs as the trait of interest (instead of disease), and test the association of a genome-wide set of SNPs with two coat color variants: yellow and dark.

The goal of this tutorial is to look at summary statistics and perform a simple association analysis starting with a variant calling file (.vcf). We will also produce Manhattan plots to visualize loci associated with yellow coat coloration in dogs.
