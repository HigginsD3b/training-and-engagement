Terminate AWS Instance
=======================

When you are done with all the analyses, be sure to terminate the AWS instance. Log in to AWS and navigate to the instances page. Then select the instance and click `Actions` --> `Instance State` --> `Terminate`

Upon termination, you will loose all the installations and data. So it is important to download all useful data before you terminate the instance!
