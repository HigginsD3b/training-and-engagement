#### Browsing the Portal

Now that we're all connected, let's explore KFDP. Our goal is twofold:
(1) Find data that is of interest to us, and
(2) Get that data onto Cavatica

* #### Explore Data

    * This is where we can get a bird's eye view of the data available. It is important to get a sense of what KFDP houses prior to designing an experiment.
    * The dashboard on this page gives us **Cohort Results** based on the dataset features we select.
    * The most expedient way to do this is to click the **Quick Filters** button. Let's try that now.
    * Choose some different options from the **Quick Filters** category and watch how your **Cohort Results** change.
    * To further refine your **Cohort Results** select more categories along the navigation bar.
    * Clicking on the graphics also adds filters to the data
    * Need to cover how to remove the filter
